# All-Me
My First Baba is You Levelpack. 10 levels total.

To start the levelpack:
 1. Extract .zip into \Baba Is You\Data\Worlds folder
 2. Ensure that the following code is in the syntax.ua file already:
    generaldata.strings[BUILD] = "debug"
    generatetiles()
    Silverhawke has a tutorial on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP-56DFoxw0
 3. Start game and go to 'Play Levels'
 4. Select "All Me v1.0"
